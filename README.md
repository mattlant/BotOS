BotOS - 2003 - A JavaScript Real-time Task-based Botting System for d2jsp.

The GitHub repo summary shows this as Roff... ROFFL! I have never seen Roff until it classified this project as Roff. This project is most definately 100% JavaScript. I guess the file extensions .d2l and .d2s are what it considers for classifying the language type.
